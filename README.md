# MP-Instagram-Feed-Project

  The aim of this project was to replicate the layout of an Instagram user account feed, based on the company's design prior to their Spring of 2019 update. 


## Deployment Instructions (How to Open Project Live)

  This project was originally developed on and run through GitPod. If you'd like to view the page live in a browser, run "python3 -m http.server 3000" in the command terminal. Once entered, Gitpod will give you options to view the project; click "Open Browser". A new tab should open up displaying the page.

## Build / Layout
The project was developed using only HTML, CSS, Font Awesome (for the Icons), and Google Fonts (to match the Instagram typography as closely as possible).
